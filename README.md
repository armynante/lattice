# Lattice Microservice Framework Specification Document
## Abstract
This document outlines a new microservice framework tailored for rapid prototyping and scalable applications. Distinct from traditional serverless architectures, it emphasizes containerization, avoidance of vendor lock-in, and supports diverse development environments in a language-agnostic manner.

A common problem with prototyping is that most of the devlopment goes into setting up the deployment and framework for develop,ment.

### 1. Introduction
Introducing a novel approach to microservices, this framework is designed to simplify the process of developing, deploying, and managing microservices. It aims to make sophisticated technologies like Docker and Kubernetes accessible and manageable, especially for rapid prototyping and scalable applications.

### 2. Core Ideology and Principles
Simplifying Microservices: Streamline the development and deployment process, making microservices more accessible.
Modularity and Independent Scaling: Each service functions independently, facilitating ease of maintenance and scalability.
Language Agnosticism: Support for multiple programming languages, catering to a wide range of developer skills and preferences.
Community-Driven Development: Encourage community contributions to expand the framework's capabilities and versatility.

### 3. Technical Specification
Service Structure: Services are organized within their own folders, with function files representing specific functionalities.
Deployment and Orchestration: Details on containerization, Kubernetes integration, and deployment strategies.
Configuration Management: How services are configured, including environment management and automatic route mapping.
Continuous Integration and Deployment: Integration with CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment workflows.

### 4. Real-World Application Examples
Music File Upload and Processing App: Demonstrates the creation of a service for uploading and processing music files, including integration with blob storage and database services.
E-commerce Backend: Showcases services for user authentication, product catalog management, order processing, and payment handling, emphasizing inter-service communication and database integration.

### 5. Differentiation from Serverless and Core Assumptions
Flexibility and Control Over Infrastructure: Unlike serverless architectures, this framework offers more transparency and control over the deployment environment.
Avoidance of Vendor Lock-in: Designed to be cloud-provider agnostic, enabling freedom in infrastructure choices.
Cost-Effective Self-Hosting: Advocates for the long-term cost benefits of self-hosting Kubernetes over reliance on managed cloud services.

### 6. Service Discovery and Documentation
Service Map Discovery: CLI and web tools for visualizing and understanding the structure and endpoints of all services within an application.
Viewing Service Inputs and Outputs: Tools to view detailed information about each service, including its inputs, outputs, and functionalities.

### 7. Public Ingress URLs
Local Development: Access services through locally defined URLs, using tools like Minikube or Docker Compose.
Deployment and Public Access: Utilization of Kubernetes Ingress for routing external traffic, automatic URL assignment, and custom domain mapping.

### 8. Conclusion
The framework presents a robust yet flexible solution for modern software development needs, aligning with the demands of rapid prototyping and scalable microservice architectures.
